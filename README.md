## Objective
To leverage HR data by answering critical questions and providing business insights that help the leadership team make data-driven decisions.

## Description
This project is a HR Analytics case study performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The analysis focuses on understanding employee workforce trends through exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization. 15 real-world HR business problems were solved through data manipulation and visual storytelling, making this project a strong demonstration of practical analytics skills applied to HR data

## Tools Used
- Python Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas: Data cleaning, manipulation, aggregation
- Matplotlib: Visualization of trends and distributions
- Seaborn: Statistical plots for detailed insight exploration

## Data Preparation and Understanding 
Before solving the business questions, several preprocessing steps were performed to ensure the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis:
- Imported the dataset and reviewed its structure, dimensions, and data types
- Checked for missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent entries
- Standardized categorical fields such as employee status and work mode
- Converted key variables like salary and years of experience into numeric formats
- Used descriptive statistics to understand distributions and core HR metrics
- Applied grouping and aggregation techniques for department- and role-level insights
- Conducted initial visual exploration to identify trends prior to deeper analysis
These Data cleaning steps ensured a clean and reliable people data for the further analysis.

## Business Insights - Decision Making
As part of the HR analytics the project addresses 15 workforce business questions designed to support strategic decision-making for HR and leadership teams.
1) Employee Status Distribution - Looked at the workforce distribution of Active, Resigned, Retired, and Terminated employees.
2) Work Mode Analysis (Remote vs On-site) - Examined employee distribution by work arrangement to understand the attendance compliance
3) Department Wise Workforce Allocation - Identified staffing levels across departments to clarify organizational structure.
4) Compensation Trends by Department - Studied average salary patterns to help with pay equity and budgeting decisions.
5) Highest Paying Job Roles - Found the top-paying job titles to showcase compensation standards.
6) Role Based Salary Comparison Across Departments - Explored how job titles affect salary differences within departments.
7) Attrition Patterns by Department - Investigated resignation and termination rates to compare the attrition rate between departments
8) Salary Growth vs Experience - Examined the years of experience and salary growth trends
9) Performance Rating Trends Across Departments - Compared performance averages at the department level to assist with talent evaluation.
10) Employee Concentration by Country - Analyzed workforce distribution by geography for global workforce planning.
11) Top Employee Locations - Identified the locations with the highest employee presence for operational insights.
12) Job Titles with Highest Resignation Rates - Highlighted roles most affected by turnover to focus on retention.
13) Education Level Impact on Salary - Examined if higher education connects with differences in compensation.
14) Salary Distribution by Work Mode - Compared salary trends between remote and on-site employees.
15) Experience Distribution Across Departments - Assessed seniority levels in departments to aid workforce development planning.
