## Objective
To leverage HR data by answering critical questions and providing business insights that help the leadership team make data-driven decisions.

## Description
This project is a HR Analytics case study performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The analysis focuses on understanding employee workforce trends through exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization. 15 real-world HR business problems were solved through data manipulation and visual storytelling, making this project a strong demonstration of practical analytics skills applied to HR data

## Tools Used
- Python Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas: Data cleaning, manipulation, aggregation
- Matplotlib: Visualization of trends and distributions
- Seaborn: Statistical plots for detailed insight exploration

## Data Preparation and Understanding 
Before solving the business questions, several preprocessing steps were performed to ensure the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis:
- Imported the dataset and reviewed its structure, dimensions, and data types
- Checked for missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent entries
- Standardized categorical fields such as employee status and work mode
- Converted key variables like salary and years of experience into numeric formats
- Used descriptive statistics to understand distributions and core HR metrics
- Applied grouping and aggregation techniques for department- and role-level insights
- Conducted initial visual exploration to identify trends prior to deeper analysis
These Data cleaning steps ensured a clean and reliable people data for the further analysis.
